# Direct API Reference


The Direct API is an interface layer between the primary user interface API (the Builders) and the OpenCascade (OCCT) API. This API is based on the CadQuery Direct API (thank you to all of the CadQuery contributors that made this possible) with the following major changes:


-

PEP8 compliance


-

New Axis class


-

New ShapeList class enabling sorting and filtering of shape objects


-

Literal strings replaced with Enums

Generate a palette of evenly spaced colors.


Creates a list of visually distinct colors suitable for representing discrete categories (such as different parts, assemblies, or data series). Colors are evenly spaced around the hue circle and share consistent lightness and saturation levels, resulting in balanced perceptual contrast across all hues.


Produces palettes similar in appearance to the Tableau 10  and D3 Category10  color sets—both widely recognized standards in data visualization for their clarity and accessibility. These values have been empirically chosen to maintain consistent perceived brightness across hues while avoiding overly vivid or dark colors.


Parameters:


-

color_count ( int) – Number of colors to generate.


-

starting_hue ( ColorLike | float) – Either a Color-like object or a hue value in the range [0.0, 1.0] that defines the starting color.


-

alpha ( float | Iterable[ float]) – Alpha value(s) for the colors. Can be a single float or an iterable of length color_count.

inverse()→ Location

mirror( mirror_plane: Plane)→ Location


Return a new Location mirrored across the given plane.


This method reflects both the position and orientation of the current Location across the specified mirror_plane using affine vector mathematics.


Due to the mathematical properties of reflection:


-

The true mirror of a right-handed coordinate system is a left-handed  one.


However, build123d  requires all coordinate systems to be right-handed. Therefore, this implementation: - Reflects the X and Z directions across the mirror plane - Recomputes the Y direction as: Y = X × Z


This ensures the resulting Location maintains a valid right-handed frame, while remaining as close as possible to the geometric mirror.


Parameters:


mirror_plane ( Plane) – The plane to mirror across.


Returns:


A new mirrored Location that preserves right-handedness.


Return type:

class Plane(* args, ** kwargs)


A plane is positioned in space with a coordinate system such that the plane is defined by the origin, x_dir (X direction), y_dir (Y direction), and z_dir (Z direction) of this coordinate system, which is the “local coordinate system” of the plane.

## Topological Objects


The topological object classes defined by build123d are defined below.


Note that the Mixin1D  and Mixin3D  classes add supplementary functionality specific to 1D ( Edge  and Wire) and 3D ( Compound  and ~topology.Solid) objects respectively. Note that a Compound  may be contain only 1D, 2D ( Face) or 3D objects.


class Compound( obj: TopoDS_Compound| Iterable[ Shape]| None= None, label: str='', color: Color| None= None, material: str='', joints: dict[ str, Joint]| None= None, parent: Compound| None= None, children: Sequence[ Shape]| None= None)[source]


A Compound in build123d is a topological entity representing a collection of geometric shapes grouped together within a single structure. It serves as a container for organizing diverse shapes like edges, faces, or solids. This hierarchical arrangement facilitates the construction of complex models by combining simpler shapes. Compound plays a pivotal role in managing the composition and structure of intricate 3D models in computer-aided design (CAD) applications, allowing engineers and designers to work with assemblies of shapes as unified entities for efficient modeling and analysis.

param_at( position: float)→ float[source]


Map a normalized arc-length position to the underlying OCCT parameter.


Returns the native OCCT curve parameter corresponding to the given normalized position (0.0 → start, 1.0 → end). For closed/periodic edges, OCCT may return a value outside  the edge’s nominal parameter range [param_min, param_max] (e.g., by adding/subtracting multiples of the period). If you require a value folded into the edge’s range, apply a modulo with the parameter span.


Parameters:


position ( float) – Normalized arc-length position along the shape, where 0.0  is the start and 1.0  is the end. Values outside [0.0, 1.0]  are not validated and yield OCCT-dependent results.


Returns:


OCCT parameter (for edges) or  composite “edgeIndex + fraction” parameter (for wires), as described above.


Return type:


float


param_at_point( point: Vector| tuple[ float, float]| tuple[ float, float, float]| Sequence[ float])→ float[source]


Return the normalized parameter (∈ [0.0, 1.0]) of the location on this edge closest to point.


This method always returns a normalized  parameter across the edge’s full OCCT parameter range, even though the underlying OCP/OCCT queries work in native (non-normalized) parameters. It is robust to several OCCT quirks:


1) Vertex snap (fast path) If point  coincides (within tolerance) with one of the edge’s vertices, that vertex’s OCCT parameter is used and normalized to [0, 1]. Note: for a closed edge, a vertex may represent both start and end; the mapping is therefore ambiguous and either end may be chosen.


2) Projection via GeomAPI_ProjectPointOnCurve The OCCT projector’s LowerDistanceParameter()  can legitimately return a value outside  the edge’s [param_min, param_max] (e.g., periodic curves or implementation behavior). The result is wrapped back into range using a modulo by the parameter span and then normalized to [0, 1]. The projected answer is accepted only if re-evaluating the 3D point at that normalized parameter is within tolerance of the input point.


3) Fallback numeric search (robust path) If the projector fails the validation, a bounded 1D search is performed over [0, 1] using progressive subdivision and local minimization of the 3D distance ‖edge(u) - point‖. The first minimum found under geometric resolution is returned.


Parameters:


point ( VectorLike) – A point expected to lie on this edge (within tolerance).


Raises:


-

ValueError – If point  is not on the edge within tolerance.


-

ValueError – Can’t find param on empty edge


-

RuntimeError – If no parameter can be found (e.g., extremely pathological curves or numerical failure).


Returns:


Normalized parameter in [0.0, 1.0] corresponding to the point’s closest location on the edge.


Return type:


float

Project Edge


Project an Edge onto a Shape generating new wires on the surfaces of the object one and only one of direction  or center  must be provided. Note that one or more wires may be generated depending on the topology of the target object and location/direction of projection.

-

center – Conical center of projection. Defaults to None.

class Face( obj: TopoDS_Face| Plane, label: str='', color: Color| None= None, parent: Compound| None= None)[source]


class Face( outer_wire: Wire, inner_wires: Iterable[ Wire]| None= None, label: str='', color: Color| None= None, parent: Compound| None= None)


A Face in build123d represents a 3D bounded surface within the topological data structure. It encapsulates geometric information, defining a face of a 3D shape. These faces are integral components of complex structures, such as solids and shells.

Returns:

Return type:


float


property axes_of_symmetry: list[ Axis]


Computes and returns the axes of symmetry for a planar face.


The method determines potential symmetry axes by analyzing the face’s geometry:


-

It first validates that the face is non-empty and planar.


-

For faces with inner wires (holes), it computes the centroid of the holes and the face’s overall center (COG).


-

If the holes’ centroid significantly deviates from the COG (beyond a specified tolerance), the symmetry axis is taken along the line connecting these points; otherwise, each hole’s center is used to generate a candidate axis.


-

For faces without holes, candidate directions are derived by sampling midpoints along the outer wire’s edges.


-

If curved edges are present, additional candidate directions are obtained from an oriented bounding box (OBB) constructed around the face.


For each candidate direction, the face is split by a plane (defined using the candidate direction and the face’s normal). The top half of the face is then mirrored across this plane, and if the area of the intersection between the mirrored half and the bottom half matches the bottom half’s area within a small tolerance, the direction is accepted as an axis of symmetry.


Returns:


A list of Axis objects, each defined by the face’s


center and a direction vector, representing the symmetry axes of the face.


Return type:


list[ Axis]


Raises:


-

ValueError – If the face or its underlying representation is empty.

wrap( planar_shape: Face, surface_loc: Location, tolerance: float= 0.001, extension_factor: float= 0.1)→ Face


wrap


Wrap a planar 2D shape onto a 3D surface.


This method conforms a 2D shape defined on the XY plane (Edge, Wire, or Face) to the curvature of a non-planar 3D Face (the target surface), starting at a specified surface location. The operation attempts to preserve the original edge lengths and shape as closely as possible while minimizing the geometric distortion that naturally arises when mapping flat geometry onto curved surfaces.


The wrapping process follows the local orientation of the surface and progressively fits each edge along the curvature. To help ensure continuity, the first and last edges are extended and trimmed to close small gaps introduced by distortion. The final shape is tightly aligned to the surface geometry.


This method is useful for applying flat features—such as decorative patterns, cutouts, or boundary outlines—onto curved or freeform surfaces while retaining their original proportions.


Parameters:


-

planar_shape ( Edge | Wire | Face) – flat shape to wrap around surface


-

surface_loc ( Location) – location on surface to wrap


-

tolerance ( float, optional) – maximum allowed error. Defaults to 0.001


-

extension_factor ( float, optional) – amount to extend the wrapped first and last edges to allow them to cross. Defaults to 0.1


Raises:


ValueError – Invalid planar shape


Returns:


wrapped shape


Return type:

wrap_faces( faces: Iterable[ Face], path: Wire| Edge, start: float= 0.0)→ ShapeList[ Face][source]


Wrap a sequence of 2D faces onto a 3D surface, aligned along a guiding path.


This method places multiple planar Face  objects (defined in the XY plane) onto a curved 3D surface ( self), following a given path (Wire or Edge) that lies on or closely follows the surface. Each face is spaced along the path according to its original horizontal (X-axis) position, preserving the relative layout of the input faces.


The wrapping process attempts to maintain the shape and size of each face while minimizing distortion. Each face is repositioned to the origin, then individually wrapped onto the surface starting at a specific point along the path. The face’s new orientation is defined using the path’s tangent direction and the surface normal at that point.


This is particularly useful for placing a series of features—such as embossed logos, engraved labels, or patterned tiles—onto a freeform or cylindrical surface, aligned along a reference edge or curve.


Parameters:


-

faces ( Iterable[ Face]) – An iterable of 2D planar faces to be wrapped.


-

path ( Wire | Edge) – A curve on the target surface that defines the alignment direction. The X-position of each face is mapped to a relative position along this path.

Returns:


A list of wrapped face objects, aligned and conformed to the


surface.

curvature_comb( count: int= 100, max_tooth_size: float| None= None)→ ShapeList[ Edge][source]


Build a curvature comb  for a planar (XY) 1D curve.


A curvature comb is a set of short line segments (“teeth”) erected perpendicular to the curve that visualize the signed curvature κ(u). Tooth length is proportional to |κ|  and the direction encodes the sign (left normal for κ>0, right normal for κ<0). This is useful for inspecting fairness and continuity (C0/C1/C2) of edges and wires.


Parameters:


-

count ( int, optional) – Number of uniformly spaced samples over the normalized parameter. Increase for a denser comb. Defaults to 100.


-

max_tooth_size ( float | None, optional) – Maximum tooth height in model units. If None, set to 10% maximum curve dimension. Defaults to None.


Raises:


-

ValueError – Empty curve.


-

ValueError – If the curve is not planar on Plane.XY.


Returns:


A list of short Edge  objects (lines) anchored on the curve and oriented along the left normal n̂ = normalize(t) × +Z.


Return type:


ShapeList[ Edge]


Notes


-

On circles, κ = 1/R so tooth length is constant.


-

On straight segments, κ = 0 so no teeth are drawn.


-

At inflection points κ→0 and the tooth flips direction.


-

At C0 corners the tangent is discontinuous; nearby teeth may jump. C1 yields continuous direction; C2 yields continuous magnitude as well.


Example


>>> comb = my_wire.curvature_comb(count=200, max_tooth_size=2.0)
>>> show(my_wire, Curve(comb))

-

Until.NEXT — Extrude forward until the first intersecting surface.


-

Until.LAST — Extrude forward through all intersections, stopping at


the farthest surface. * Until.PREVIOUS — Reverse the extrusion direction and stop at the first intersecting surface behind the profile. * Until.FIRST — Reverse the direction and stop at the farthest surface behind the profile.


When Until.PREVIOUS  or Until.FIRST  are used, the extrusion direction is automatically inverted before execution.

The is_frenet parameter controls how the profile orientation changes as it follows along the sweep path. If is_frenet is False, the orientation of the profile is kept consistent from point to point. The resulting shape has the minimum possible twisting. Unintuitively, when a profile is swept along a helix, this results in the orientation of the profile slowly creeping (rotating) as it follows the helix. Setting is_frenet to True prevents this.


If is_frenet is True the orientation of the profile is based on the local curvature and tangency vectors of the path. This keeps the orientation of the profile consistent when sweeping along a helix (because the curvature vector of a straight helix always points to its axis). However, when path is not a helix, the resulting shape can have strange looking twists sometimes. For more information, see Frenet Serret formulas http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet%E2%80%93Serret_formulas.

Multi section sweep


Sweep through a sequence of profiles following a path.


The is_frenet parameter controls how the profile orientation changes as it follows along the sweep path. If is_frenet is False, the orientation of the profile is kept consistent from point to point. The resulting shape has the minimum possible twisting. Unintuitively, when a profile is swept along a helix, this results in the orientation of the profile slowly creeping (rotating) as it follows the helix. Setting is_frenet to True prevents this.


If is_frenet is True the orientation of the profile is based on the local curvature and tangency vectors of the path. This keeps the orientation of the profile consistent when sweeping along a helix (because the curvature vector of a straight helix always points to its axis). However, when path is not a helix, the resulting shape can have strange looking twists sometimes.
